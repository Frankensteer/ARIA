<p>This is the first page users will see when they visit the app</p>

<p>It will have a login button that makes a request to Facebook to authorise the user and log them in. This might be tricky to do without a server to store profile data, Niall will research how best to proceed.</p>

<p>The only other piece of functionality it needs is a search box that queries an API and returns info about a band/artist.</p>
